## Stable Diffusion Cheat-Sheet

This began as a personal collection of styles and notes. I was curious to see how the artists used in the prompts looked without the other keywords.

[Download the zip file](https://github.com/SupaGruen/StableDiffusion-CheatSheet/releases/tag/v1.0.0) and use it as your own personal cheat sheet - completely offline. You can also inspect image metadata without launching Stable Diffusion. I just hope it's as useful to someone else as it is to me.
