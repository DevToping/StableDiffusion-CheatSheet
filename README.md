# SD-CheatSheet

### Stable Diffusion Experiment / Cheat-Sheet

I was curious after reading about Stable Diffusion (SD) and its ability to reproduce certain artists' styles, so I conducted my own tests. Each image was created by SD using either the DreamShaper or the Deliberate Checkpoint. Even though the concept of a style (color, medium, time/location, etc.) and, to some extent, a similarity is present, the generated images don't resemble the originals in the slightest.

The images, JSON file, and a simplified version of my "cheat sheet" (JS instead of PHP) are all being uploaded in case they prove to be helpful to someone.
